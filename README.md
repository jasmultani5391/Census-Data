# Census-Data: Predicting Salary Range

## Motivation:
The goal of this supervised machine learning algorithm is to decide which socioeconomic factors will reliably predict whether an individual makes less than or more than $50,000 yearly. The dataset being used is found on UCI’s machine learning repository and was collected in 1994.

## What to expect when opening the file:
I have compiled each phase of building the algorithm, from preprocessing to analysis, into this one file. Annotation on steps are as following, and can be found embedded within the code:

 <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
         <li>Step 1: Data introduction</li>
         <li>Step 2: Data clean-up</li>
         <li>Step 3: Creating dataframes by varying features</li>
         <li>Step 4: Exploring data visually</li>
         <li>Step 5: Training labeled data on K Nearest Classifier</li>
         <li>Step 6: Training labeled data on Decision Forest Classifier</li>
         <li>Step 7: Training labeled data on Logistic Regression Classifier</li>
      </ul>
